Description
This is a submission for my homework for week 3

In this assignnment i was tasked with creating a random password generator using JavaScript. 

Inorder to complete this task i used a combination of Arrays, variables, if statments, forloops and functions.

Arrays, were used to store the data for a user to creat a password in the form of uppercase/lowercase letters and numbers/characters.

Variables, were used with the promt and confirm function to create a string text wich would display once a user had added data or progressed through the selections.

If statments were used to add logic to the the program once options had been sellected.

forloops were used, to run the code a specific amount of time.

Functions were used, to preform a task of generating the password.
